## API Integration Details

### Endpoint

```
GET /api/v1/medicine-action-items-details/location/{locationId}
```

### Expected Response Format

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "data": [
    {
      "actionItemId": 1,
      "medicineId": 101,

    }
  ]
}
```

### Action Types Supported

- `OUT_OF_STOCK` - Stock is completely depleted
- `CRITICALLY_LOW` - Stock is below threshold

## User Experience Flow

1. **Location Selection**: User selects a location on the Dashboard
2. **Data Loading**: CriticalStock component automatically fetches action items for selected location
3. **Data Display**: Shows critical stock issues with appropriate color coding and details
4. **Act Now**: User clicks "Act Now" button → redirects to Medicine Stock page with location context preserved
5. **Stock Management**: User can manage medicine stock for the same location

## Error Handling

- **No Location Selected**: Shows message prompting user to select a location
- **API Errors**: Displays error message with retry capability
- **Empty Results**: Shows success message when no critical issues found
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during API calls

## Technical Implementation

- Uses existing `get()` function from `apiService.js`
- Leverages `apiDomain` constant for base URL
- Implements React hooks for state management
- Uses `useNavigate` for programmatic navigation
- SessionStorage for location context persistence

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with different location selections
2. Verify API response handling for all action types
3. Test "Act Now" navigation and location context preservation
4. Verify error handling with invalid/non-existent locations
5. Test loading states and empty responses

## Future Enhancements

- Add pagination for large datasets
- Implement filtering by action type
- Add export functionality for critical stock reports
- Include more detailed stock information in the table
- Add real-time updates with WebSocket integration
