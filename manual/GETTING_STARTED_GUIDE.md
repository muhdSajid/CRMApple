Let's complete a simple task to get familiar with the system.

### Task: View Medicine Stock

   - Medicine name
   - Category
   - Current quantity
   - Minimum level
   - Status (color-coded)

2. Details expand showing:
   - Complete information
   - Batch details with expiry dates
   - Stock history
3. Click again to collapse

✅ **Done!** You've viewed the stock list.

## Step 6: Understanding Key Concepts

### Batch / Lot

A **batch** is a group of medicines from the same production run.

**Why batches matter:**

- Track origin and manufacturer
- Monitor expiry dates
- Quality control
- Traceability for recalls

**Example:** Lot#2024001, Manufactured 01-Jan-2024, Expires 31-Dec-2025

### Location

A **location** is a delivery center or distribution point.

**Examples:**

- Hospital in City A
- Clinic in City B
- Warehouse in City C

### Distribution

A **distribution** is when medicines are sent to a location or patient.

**Two types:**

- **By Location:** Send to delivery center
- **By Patient:** Give to individual patient

### Status

Tracks the progress of a distribution:

- 🟢 **Pending** - Ready to be sent
- 🟡 **In Transit** - On the way
- 🔵 **Delivered** - Received
- ⚫ **Cancelled** - Not going
- 🔴 **Failed** - Delivery problem
